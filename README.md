# 2-CSS-Boostrap

Second Homework assignment for CWRU Bootcamp

This assignment consists of three pages, intended to be the framework for an online portfolio page.  

Please note that I have interpreted line 22 of the homework assignment readme with some artistic liscence. I took it as a go ahead and personalize this page to myself. Functionally all the elements from the example screenshots are present, I have just applied personal style to the pages. 

Screenshot of each page:
